# purescript-ebyam

![Ebyam Mascot](/assets/mascot.jpg?raw=true "Ebyam Mascot")

Optional values. `Maybe` is often used to capture failures and in cases where nullable values might otherwise have been used in other languages.

Basically a copy of my purescript-ebyam. Turns out I enjoy using ebyam in Haskell too.

## Installation

```
stack install haskell-ebyam
```
